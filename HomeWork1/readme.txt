This C++ program can convert a mathematical expression in prefix notation to infix notation. 
It works by iterating through the prefix expression and pushing operators onto a stack while adding 
operands to the result string. When an operand is encountered, the top operator on the stack is popped and 
added to the result string, with the operand on either side.

To use the program, simply modify the main function to call prefixToInfix with the desired prefix 
expression as the argument. The program will output the original prefix notation expression, 
followed by the corresponding infix notation expression.
